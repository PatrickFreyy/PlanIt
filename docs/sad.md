## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural 
views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural 
decisions which have been made on the system.

### 1.2 Scope

This document describes the technical architecture of the PlanIt project, including module structure and dependencies as 
well as the structure of classes.

### 1.3 Overview

This document contains the architectural representation, goals and constraints as well as logical, deployment, 
implementation and data views.

## 2. Architectural Representation

Our project PlanIt uses the model-view-controler(MVC) structure as follows:

![QUDC] 

## 3. Architectural Goals And Constraints

Actualy we are not decide on a framework. But we use Java for the backend and the frontend. Also the communication between the controler and the view and data model is in Java.
 
Because our application is a local one, we do not take the first look at the data security.  

## 4. Use-Case View

This is our overall use-case diagram:

## 5. Logical View

### 5.1 Overview

We split our architecture according to the MVC architecture as follows:

## 6. Process View

N/A

## 7. Deployment View

N/A

## 8. Implementation View

![OUBD]

## 9. Data View

Our data view is modelled in our class diagramm, because the attributes are the attributes from the enities.

## 10. Size and Performance

N/A

## 11. Quality/Metrics

N/A

## 12. Patterns

N/A
